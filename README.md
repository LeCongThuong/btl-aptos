## 1. Goal:
The repository is for the Introduction To Bioinformatics (INT6160) subject. The aim is that to
* train models following the approach used by 1st team in APTOS 2019.
* analyze the trained model using the Grad-CAM methods to answer the question "What regions in an image is a model see on to make decision?"

## 2. Data
The data used to train model from APTOS 2015 and APTOS 2019: [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/benjaminwarner/resized-2015-2019-blindness-detection-images).

## 3. Notebooks

* 04_evaluate.ipynb: to check result of the metrics of the trained model.
* 05_trained_model_inspect.ipynb: to check analysis the trained model by using the Grad-CAM method.
